# Introduction

Welcome to the magpie API! You can use our API to incorporate user specific learning recommendations in your application, based on various inputs. You will be able to generate recommendations from content in an instance of magpie, retrieve information on your organisation, a user's profile and asset metadata.

Requests are made in the context of a user taking actions that trigger the API calls and not at an administrator level.
The API uses the JSON-RPC protocol (jsonrpc2). There is a client-side library available too as a way to speed up and simplify integration.


# Authentication

> Request Payload:

```shell
{
    "id":    "99850fed-cf9c-4b15-9b5c-e901beb29cc5",
    "email": "wile@acme.com",
    "name":  "Wile E.",
}

```


Both server-side and client-side use [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/) (JWT). This will require some server-side code in both cases.
There are off-the-shelf [libraries](https://jwt.io/#libraries) available for many languages. The JWT will be signed and encrypted.

An api key, secret key and organisation will be provided. These will be used to identify and authorise the requester.

The payload format is as follows

Name | Type | Notes
--------- | ------- | -----------
id | String | Max ? chars. Any format. No personal information.
email | String, Optional | Max ? chars.
name | String, Optional | Max ? chars.
